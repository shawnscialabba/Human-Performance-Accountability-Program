# Human-Performance-Accountability-Program

### Challenge

Identified a pattern of recurring spills/errors during non-routine maintenance, linked to inadequate supervision and a culture where management owned the workers' compliance with basic administrative controls.

### Strategy (Maintenance Control & Worker Ownership)

Established and enforced a rigorous accountability framework: mandated that the Chief Certifying Officer physically monitor all non-routine maintenance jobs (Person-In-Charge). Shifted ownership of administrative compliance (e.g., "Check Chem" certifications) from management back to the individual worker, requiring formal critique reports for lapses.

### Outcome

The enforcement of heightened accountability and direct supervision successfully **eliminated spills and major mistakes** during non-routine maintenance over a three-year period, validating the direct link between human factors discipline and operational safety.
